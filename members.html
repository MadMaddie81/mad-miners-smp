                    Hello everyone! <br>
                    I'm Maddie and I've been running this server since Feb 2021. <br>
                    I live in Sweden and have been playing Minecraft since 2019. <br>
                    I'm mainly a builder but try to expand my Minecraft knowledge and learn more redstone. <br> 
                    I'm getting pretty good at it. <br>
                    I started making YouTube videos in 2020 and I also stream on Twitch once in awhile.

                    Hi folks! My name's Sophie and I'm a MadMiners server moderator. <br> 
                    I've been a long time miner & crafter for about 9 years now. I played Java a little in college. Then swapped to Xbox 360 console when my potato of a PC died. Played that until the "great shift" to Bedrock. <br>
                    I primarily enjoy Bedrock Minecraft, but do dabble in java hardcore and some java servers as well for research reasons.

                    Hello everyone! <br> 
                    My name is Nana and I've been playing Minecraft every once in a while since it came out but I started playing seriously in 2019. <br>
                    I was born in May/2000 and I live in Saudi Arabia (so Arabic is my first language) <br>
                    My server/Minecraft bestie is Coop (LegendStarcraft) <br>
                    When it comes to my style of playing I am a bit of everything. I like building, redstone/auto farms, strip mining, achievment hunting and exploring the over world <br>
                    I tried speed running the game a couple of times before but didn't really end up "winning"
