# MadMiners SMP

This project is dedicated to the MadMiners SMP Minecraft server.
It provides the viewers with facts about the server and its members, states the community's values and offers a way to apply for a server membership.

The page can be linked in our members' YouTube videos or be offered to people looking for a server to join.

## Features

## Testing & Bug Log
* Getting the header and background to behave as desired on different plattforms took a lot of trial and error. I'm still not 100% satisfied with the result, but it's getting there. 
* Upon first deploying the project to GitHub Pages the header images didn't load. I quickly realised my misstake of using absolute file paths and the bug was quickly solved by removing some slashes.

## Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the Main Branch source. <br>
