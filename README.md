## __Features__

### __The Core Elements__

These are the features that will companion the viewer through all the pages and bring cohesiveness to the project.

#### __The Background__

![Background](assets/docs/readme-imgs/background-og.png)
* The original image used for the background is a screenshot from day one of the current season of the MadMiners server. 
* It depicts a gorgeous mountain landscape with a pittoresque village that starts in the valley between the mountains and then climbs up the mountain to the right.
* This is the view you are met with when logging onto the server for the first time.
* The picture has been blurred up in Photoshop to not take focus away from the content of the site.
* The background is fixed in position and will stay put as the viewer scrolls through the pages.
* Many of the elements on the site has a background colour with lowered opacity to allow for the background picture to shine through.

#### __The Header__

![Header](assets/docs/readme-imgs/readme-header.png)

* All the way at the top the official Minecraft Bedrock Edition logo presides, eliminating all doubt of what version of the game the server is hosting.
    * There are two editions of the game; Minecraft Bedrock, which is written in C++ and is accessible on all major consoles as well as Windows 10 and iOS/Android. The other version is Minecraft Java, and as the name says it's written in Java and is basically only accessible on PC. Both versions has their pros and cons.
* The header's other feature is a MadMiners SMP logo I created in Photoshop using the same style and font as the official Minecraft logo.
    * SMP is an abbreviation of Survival Multiplayer, which is a common playstyle in Minecraft.

#### __The Navigation Bar__

The navigation bar is the fully interactive main hub of the project that will easily bring the viewer to all corners of the site as well as an external link to the MadMiners Discord server.
* Note the shape of the navigation bar field and the navigation buttons, with one rounded corner. This feature will echo throughout all parts of the project.
* On large screens the navigation bar appears in the upper left corner, next to the main section.
    * The location leaves plenty of room for future expansion of the site and the empty space below could be used for additional features, such as advertisement or external links.
* On smaller screens the navigation bar is located between the header and the main section.
* All buttons will react with a colour change when hovered over.
* To the left of every navigation button you will find a cute little gif of a nether star.
    * The nether star is one of the rarest and most valuable items in the game and resembles a compass star, which seemed suitable as a link marker.
* At the bottom of the navigation bar we have a comparible large button that will bring you to the MadMiners Discord server.
    * The link will open in a new tab, unless you are on a mobile device with the Discord app installed. Then the link will open up the app.
    * The size of the button emphesises the importance of the Discord server.
    * No one will be allowed to join the Minecraft server without also be a part of the Discord community.
    * The Discord server is open for everyone and isn't just reserved for the MadMiners members.
    * Besides the text, the button also has a big Font Awesome icon of the Discord logo.

#### __The Footer__
![Footer](assets/docs/readme-imgs/footer.png)
* The footer is very simple and contains a darker coloured strip and a copyright disclaimer.
* It still fills an important role as it counterbalances the header and lets the viewer know that they have reached the bottom of the page.

#### __Favicon__
![Favicon](assets/docs/readme-imgs/favicon-readme.png)
* All pages are decorated with a diamond favicon.
* The favicon appears on the browser tab and helps the viewer identify the correct website when several tabs are open.

### __The Landing Page__

The purpose of the landing page is to give the viewer a plesant first experience of the site and efficiently provide information about what type of server the MadMiners is.

![Landing](assets/docs/readme-imgs/landing.png)

* When the viewer arrives to the site they are immediately presented with a welcoming message. 
* After that they can read about the server values, accompanied by appropriate images from the server.
    * A nice house represents the ability to play the game in peace without having to worry about thieving and destructive neighbours, which is a common occurance on most public servers.
    * The second image shows some server members working together to defeat the ender dragon. This picture speaks for the inclusive, non-toxic community we have on the MadMiners SMP.
    * Lastly, the text about a high quality server is accompanied by a picture of a collection of automatic redstone farms. Redstone can be seen as a mix between mechanics and magic and is usually very appealing to the engineers, mathematicians and developers that try their hand at Minecraft. It has the potential to lag down the game and even crash a server if done wrong, but is very rewarding when done right.

### __The Information Page__

The purpose of the Info page is to give all the information the viewer might need when considering wether to apply for server membership. It tells about what the player can expect from the server, and what is expexted of them in return.

![Info](assets/docs/readme-imgs/info.png)

* The info page is divided into four segments. 
* The first segment (depicted above) has the page header, an interactive local navigation bar that gives the viewer efficient access to the other three segments, and a map over the main area of the MadMiners world.
    * The distance from the east border of the map to the west border is about 8km.
    * A marker has been put down to point out where you will spawn when first arriving to the server.
    * The white areas north and east of the provided spawn point is the mountains depicted on the site's background image.
* The next segment you get to is the server's technical data.
    * Here you will find a link to our server host. Nodecraft. This link will open in a new tab.
    * The world seed and spawn location information can be used to visit the world the server is based on in the viewer's own version of the game.
* Next we have the Server Rules segment.
    * This educates potential member applicants of what is and isn't accepted behaviour on the server.
* The last segment is a long list of all the the ways the game has been customised and tweaked on the MadMiners to ensure an optimal player experience.
* Below each segment you will find a dividing line with a button that efficiently brings you back to the top of the page.
