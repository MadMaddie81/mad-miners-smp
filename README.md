## __Features__

### __The Core Elements__

These are the features that companions the viewer through all the pages and brings cohesiveness to the project.

#### __The Background__

![Background](assets/docs/readme-imgs/background-og.png)
* The original image used for the background is a screenshot from day one of the current season of the MadMiners server. 
* It depicts a gorgeous mountain landscape with a pittoresque village that starts in the valley between the mountains and then climbs up the mountain to the right.
* This is the view you are met with when logging onto the server for the first time.
* The picture has been blurred up in Photoshop to not take focus away from the content of the site.
* The background is fixed in position and will stay put as the viewer scrolls through the pages.
* Many of the elements on the site has a background colour with lowered opacity to allow for the background picture to shine through.

#### __The Header__

* All the way at the top the official Minecraft Bedrock Edition logo presides, eliminating all doubt of what version of the game the server is hosting.
    * There are two editions of the game; Minecraft Bedrock, which is written in C++ and is accessible on all major consoles as well as Windows 10 and iOS/Android. The other version is Minecraft Java, and as the name says it's written in Java and is basically only accessible on PC. Both versions has their pros and cons.
* The header's other feature is a MadMiners SMP logo I created in Photoshop using the same style and font as the official Minecraft logo.

#### __The Navigation Bar__

The navigation bar is the fully interactive main hub of the project that will easily bring the viewer to all corners of the site as well as an external link to the MadMiners Discord server.
* Note the shape of the navigation bar field and the navigation buttons, with one rounded corner. This feature will echo throughout all parts of the project.
* On large screens the navigation bar appears in the upper left corner, next to the main section.
    * The location leaves plenty of room for future expansion of the site and the empty space below could be used for additional features, such as advertisement or external links.
* On smaller screens the navigation bar is located between the header and the main section.
* All buttons will react with a colour change when hovered over.
* To the left of every navigation button you will find a cute little gif of a nether star.
    * The nether star is one of the rarest and most valuable items in the game and resembles a compass star, which seemed suitable as a link marker.
* At the bottom of the navigation bar we have a comparible large button that will bring you to the MadMiners Discord server.
    * The link will open in a new tab, unless you are on a mobile device with the Discord app installed. Then the link will open up the app.
    * The size of the button emphesises the importance of the Discord server.
    * No one will be allowed to join the Minecraft server without also be a part of the Discord community.
    * The Discord server is open for everyone and isn't just reserved for the MadMiners members.
    * Besides the text, the button also has a big Font Awesome icon of the Discord logo.

#### __The Footer__
![Footer](assets/docs/readme-imgs/footer.png)
* The footer is very simple and contains a darker coloured strip and a copyright disclaimer.
* It still fills an important role as it counterbalances the header and lets the viewer know that they have reached the bottom of the page.
