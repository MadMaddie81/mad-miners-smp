# __MadMiners SMP__

This project is dedicated to the MadMiners SMP Minecraft server.
It provides the viewers with facts about the server and its members, states the community's values and offers a way to apply for a server membership.

The page can be linked in the members' YouTube videos or be offered to people looking for a server to join.

## __Features__

### __Layout__

When I started this project I began by creating the layout I wanted in Photoshop and then I tried to recreate it in Gitpod. <br>
The layout is made to prepare for possible future add-space below the navigation section.

### __Header & Navigation__

* Featured on all pages throughout the project.
* The responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Server Faq, Members and How To Join. It also has a link to a Discord server that will open in a new tab.

### __Server Values Section__

* The main page house the server values, which presents the viewer with what they can expect from a server membership and what will be expected from them in return.
* It imediately tells the viewer that the MadMiners is a server fit for more mature Minecraft players, who aren't amused by kids blowing up their house with tnt.

## __Testing & Bug Log__

As I go along with my project I have been checking my pushed commits in Chrome, Edge and iOS (both iPhone and iPad). I have also been using the developer tools in Chrome to see how the pages respond.

* Getting the header and background to behave as desired on different plattforms took a lot of trial and error. I'm still not 100% satisfied with the result, but it's getting there. 
* Upon first deploying the project to GitHub Pages the header images didn't load. I quickly realised my misstake of using absolute file paths and the bug was quickly solved by removing some slashes.
* I wanted to make the little star gif in the nav bar to only be visible while hovering or active. I spent way too long trying to make it behave as I want. I might return to it later.
* I also wanted to make the nav bar fixed so it would follow along when scrolling. It got way too complicated to make it stay where I wanted when changing the viewport size. That kind of feature is easier to handle when it's at the top instead of to the side.
